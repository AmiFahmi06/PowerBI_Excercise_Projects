# PowerBI_Excercise_Projects
These two exercises helps me to know the way to connect and transform data, build and create relational data models, add calculated fields with basics DAX knowledge. 

# 1) Adventure Works Cycles:

## Situation:
I've just been hired by Adventure Works Cyles , a global manufacturing company, to design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution-from scratch!

## Brief:
My client needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts and  identify high-value customers.
All I've been given is a folder of raw csv files, containing information about transactions, returns, products, customers and territories.

# 2) Maven Market:

## Situation:
The Adventure Works clients were so impressed by your work that they referred you for another contract. This time you will be working with Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Just like the Adventure Works project, you will be working through the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the source data, building a relational model, adding calculated columns and measures, and designing an interactive report. Unfortunately I will be out of town for the next few months on a bird watching excursion in a remote corner of the Chilean Andes, so you will be on your own for this one. That said, I have the utmost confidence in your abilities -- you'll do great!

I have attached all of the files you need to get started:

- Maven Market logo

- Zipped folder containing the 8 CSV files you'll need to build your report

## Brief:
My client needs a way to track KPIs (current month transactions, profit and returns), compare country performance, analyze product-level trends and forecast and identify high-value country's product brand.

## Objectives of the projects:
- Connect and transform raw data
- Build a relational data model
- Create new calculated columns and DAX measures
- Design an interactive report to analyze and visualize the data
